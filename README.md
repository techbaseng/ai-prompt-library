## ✨ Design

A complete visual refresh built around a **bright, light, tech-product aesthetic**:

- **Light theme** — white/off-white surfaces (`#FAFBFE`), soft dot-grid texture, no dark mode fatigue
- **"Dev tool" identity** — each prompt card is styled like a code-editor tab (colored dot + mono filename like `image-generation/042.prompt`), prompt text sits in a code-pane with a colored left gutter
- **Typeface system** — Space Grotesk (headings), Manrope (body), JetBrains Mono (code/prompts/badges)
- **Brand gradient** — Indigo → Cyan → Tangerine, used in the logo mark, hero headline, and soft animated blob backgrounds
- **Custom line-icon set** — every category has a hand-picked SVG icon (no emoji), color-coded and consistent throughout sidebar, hero tiles, and mobile nav
- **Mobile-first** — built from a 360px base upward through 5 breakpoints (420 / 640 / 960 / 1240 / 1600px); sidebar becomes a slide-over drawer below 960px with a bottom tab bar taking over navigation
